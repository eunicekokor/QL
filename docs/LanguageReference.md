## 1.0 Introduction
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open-standard format that uses human-readable format to capture attribute-value pairs. JSON has gained prominence replacing XML encoded-data in browser-server communication, particularly with the explosion of RESTful APIs and AJAX requests that often make use of JSON.

While domain-specific languages like SQL and PostgreSQL work with relational databases, languages like AWK specialize in processing datatables, especially tab-separated files. We noticed a need for a language designed to interact with JSON data, to quickly search through JSON structures and run meaningful queries.

## 2.0 Data Types
### 2.1 Primitive Types
All primitive data types are passed by value. They can each be declared and then initialized later (their value is null in the interim) or declared and initialized in-line.

#### 2.1.1 Integers (`int`)
Integers are signed, 8-byte literals denoting a number as a sequence of digits e.g. `5`,`6`,`-1`,`0`.

#### 2.1.2 Floating Point Numbers (`float`)
Floats are signed, 8-byte single-precision floating point numbers e.g. `-3.14`, `4e10`, `.1`, `2.`.

#### 2.1.3 Boolean (`bool`)
Booleans are defined by the `true` and `false` keywords. Only boolean types can be used in logical expressions e.g. `true`, `false`.

#### 2.1.4 String (`string`)
Since our language doesn't contain characters, strings are the only way of expressing zero or more characters in the language. Each string is enclosed by two quotation marks e.g. `"e"`, `"Hello, world!"`.

### 2.2 Non-Primitive Types
All non-primitive data types are passed by a reference in memory. They can each be declared and initialized later (their value is null in the interim) or declared and initialized in line.


#### 2.2.1 Arrays (`array`)
Arrays represent multiple instances of one of the primitive data types represente as contiguous memory. The square bracket notation is used to create an array and then get direct access to elements. Each array must The size of the array is fixed at the time of its creation e.g. `[1,2,3]`, `["my", "name"]`, `[true, false, false, true]`

#### 2.2.2 JSON (`json`)
Since the language must search and return results from JSON files, it supports Jsons as a non-primitive type. A `json` object can be created through multiple mechanisms. The first is directly from a filename of a valid JSON. For example, one could write: `json a = json("file1.json")`. This will check `file1.json` to ensure it is a valid JSON, and if so, will store the JSON in the variable `a`. The second way to obtain a JSON object is by using a subset of a current JSON. For example, say the following variable is already set:

```
b = {
    "size":10,
    "links": {
        "1": 1,
        "2": 2,
        "3": 3
    }
}
```

QL then allows for commands like `json links = b["links"]`. The links variable would then look as follows:

```
links = {
    "1" : 1,
    "2" : 2,
    "3" : 3
}
```

#### 4.3.1 `[]` : attribute access

This can be used in two different ways:

- [int `index`]: accesses value at `index` of array
	* Return type is the same as the array’s type.

- [string `key`]: accesses value at `key` of JSON
	* Return type is inferred from the value in JSON. The type can be one of three things: a value (int, float, bool, string), an array, or a JSON.


This operator can nest, e.g.: [“data”][“views”][“total”]. It associates from left to right.

Here is a program containing different examples of the `[]` operator and their return values based on the following JSON:

```
#~~ [“data”][“views”][“total”] returns an int.

we iterate through each "data" object with a total viewcount less than 100 ~~#

where ([“data”][“views”][“total”] < 80) as item {
	#~~ item[“data”][“users”] returns an array ~~#
	array users = item[“data”][“users”]
	
	#~~ iterate through the array ~~#
	for (int i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
		#~~ print the user at index i in the array ~~#
		print users[i]
	}
	
	#~~ item[“data”][“items”][“category”] returns a string ~~#
	if (item[“data”][“items”][“category”] == “News”) {
		where (true) as name {
			print “name”	
		} in users
	}
} in json(“file1.json”)


file1.json:

[{“data”: {
	“views”: {
		"total”: 80
	},
	“items: {
		“category”: “News”
	},
	“users”: [
		“Matt”,
		“Evan”,
		“Gary”
	]
},
{“data”: {
	“views”: {
		"total”: 1000
	},
	“items: {
		“category”: “Sports”
	}
}]
```
		
#### 4.3.2 `%` : mod

- `int` % `int`: returns an int (the remainder of ($1 divided by $3))

For all other combinations of types, we throw an error (incompatible data types).

#### 4.3.3 `*` : multiplication
- `int` * `int`: returns int ($1 multiplied by $3)

- `double` * `int`, `int` * `double`,  `double` * `double`: returns double ($1 multiplied by $3)

For all other combinations of types, we throw an error (incompatible data types).

#### 4.3.4 `/` : division
- `int` / `int`: returns an int (the floor of ($1 divided by $3))

- `double` / `int`, `int` / `double`,  `double` / `double`: returns a double ($1 divided by $3)

For all other combinations of types, we throw an error (incompatible data types).

#### 4.3.5 `+` : addition
- `int` / `int`: returns int ($1 added to $3)

- `double` + `int`, `int` + `double`,  `double` + `double`: returns double ($1 added to $3)

For all other combinations of types, we throw an error (incompatible data types).

#### 4.3.6 `-` : subtraction
- `int` - `int`: returns int ($1 minus $3)

- `double` - `int`, `int` - `double`,  `double` - `double`: returns double ($1  minus $3)

For all other combinations of types, we throw an error (incompatible data types).
		
#### 4.3.7 `=` : assignment
- `anytype` = `anytype`: sets value of $1 to $3.

If the type of $1 is different from the type of $3, we throw an error.

#### 4.3.8 `!` : negation

- !`expr` = evaluates `expr` as a boolean (throws error if this is not possible); returns the opposite of `expr` (if `expr` was true, return false; if `expr` was false, return true)

If this operator is used on anything other than a bool, we throw an error.

#### 4.3.9 Equivalency operators
- == : equivalence,
- != : non-equivalence,
- \> : greater than, 
- < : less than, 
- \>= : greater than or equal to,
- <= : less than or equal to

`anytype` OP `anytype`: returns a bool (true if $1 OP $3 e.g. `3 == 3` returns true)

- if $1 and $3 are strings, we do a lexical comparison

- if $1 and $3 are both ints, or both floats, we see if they are equal

If the types are anything other than these specified combinations, we throw an error.

#### 4.3.10 Logical operators

- `expr1` & `expr2`: evaluates `expr1` and `expr2` as booleans (throws error if this is not possible), and returns true if they both evaluate to true; otherwise, returns false.

- `expr1` | `expr2`: evaluates `expr1` and `expr2` as booleans (throws error if this is not possible), and returns true if either evaluate to true; otherwise, returns false.

## 5 Standard Library Functions

Standard library functions are included with the language for convenience for the user. The first few of these functions will give users the ability to perform basic modifying operations with arrays.

###5.0 `append`
```
function append(array arr, int x) : array {

}
```

The above function takes in an array and an integer as arguments and returns an array with size increased by 1 that contains that integer at the last index.

### 5.1 `unique`

```
function unique(array arr) : array {
	
}
```

The above function receives an array as argument and returns a copy of the array with duplicate values removed. Only the first appearance of each element will be conserved, and a resulting array is returned.

### 5.2 `sort`

```
function sort(array arr) : array {
	
}
```

The above function receives an array as argument and returns a copy of the array with all of the elements sorted in ascending order. To compare the elements of the array, the `>` operator is used. For example, the array [1,4,3,5,2] passed into the sort() method would return [1,2,3,4,5]. The array [“c”,”e”,”a”,”c”,”f”] would return [“a”,”c”,”d”,”e”,”f”].
